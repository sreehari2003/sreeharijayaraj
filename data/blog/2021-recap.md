![2021 Recap - Rishi Mohan](/images/posts/2021.png)

2021 started with me being in Jodhpur.
For the last 4 years, I've been spending New Year's
eve in different places.

2017 was in Udaipur, 2018 was in Bhopal, 
2019 was in Luxembourg, 2020 was in Jodhpur.
I've enjoyed every bit of these moments 
in each of these places. It's my little
something that I don't why I like to do,
but it makes me feel little adventurous,
little rebel.

2021's New Year was supposed
to be in Chandigarh but I cancelled the plan
the last minute. I didn't really want to
break the streak but then I know life's
more than continuing a weird streak.

So, here I am, just finished watching Emily in Paris S2, 
in my bed, in 📍 Agra. It's 01:32 and I guess
the right time to ponder over the past year.

## The Goods

### 🚀 I started [Kizie](https://kizie.co) as a side-project

Kizie helped me be occupied, in my sanity. 
I'm a professional over-thinker and my free time
makes me think about random weird things.
Not getting enough time is pretty good
for someone like me. Kizie has done well enough till now,
it's making some side $$ for me but more importantly 
it has helped me learn a lot.

Not only that, I've made some great acquaintances,
connections and friends who inspire me to do better.

### 🕊 The free living

With free, I mean freedom. When you're free,
away from people's expectations and not too attached,
you have this liberty to fly. The world is too big
to focus on things that don't excite you, 
the time is too short to not be adventurous 
and write stories that you want to.

Mentally I think this realisation of free living 
has been had long back and I'm just realising it.

### ✈️ The travel

I was able to travel quite a few cities this year
and feel grateful about it considering the Covid 
condition we were in.

January I was in **Jodhpur**, February in **Pune**,
March I went to **Rishikesh**, August and September
I contented in **Goa**, November I trekked in
**Dharamshala**.

Really good experiences all over the map have
been recorded this year. Met new people,
made new friends, talked to interesting souls
and lived in the moment. Just the kind of life
I want and look forward to.

### 👯‍♂️ The people

I am grateful, that's how I would like to start.
Without the continuous coincidence of meeting
really good people, this year would've
definitely not turned out this good.

The year was also full of goodbyes 
but I think it's a part of life, 
nothing is constant. And that's why you should
cherish each and every bit of a moment
with everyone.

### 🧑‍💻 The work

It's been 6 years since I've been working at
BigBinary and I still feel lucky to be working here.
The amount of flexibility that I get 
is something I'm grateful for. 
Professionally I've learn new things 
and can definitely say I've better skills
now then an year back.

There is more, definitely much more. I can continue writing
and I would still miss a lot to sum up.
This year was good even if Corona happened,
even if goodbyes happened, even if I was anxious,
even if some plans didn't make it, 
even if I was lost, the year was still great.

If you know me, or not anymore, or will know me,
just know that I'm becoming one heck of a guy 😅
and thank you for bearing my lame jokes and unserious-ness.

Au revoir.
