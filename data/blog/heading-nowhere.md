excerpt: The thought of what life is all about and the wandering between Passion, People and Nature

---

I often ask myself what is life about. 
I never could answer this question.
I even asked this question in my school friends batch
calls and it always turned out in a fun conversation.

Sometimes **passion** seems like a good answer,
when I start working on something like [Kizie](https://kizie.co)
and it makes me feel more alive, gives me a reason
to wake up to. Passion and interest always ends up bursts,
they lapse after some time and leave me to null.
*It's definitely not permanent*.

Then comes **nature**. 
Today I got the chance to view 
a beautiful valley landscape from the top
of a place called Naddi in Himanchal Pradesh.
The view was surreal and made me feel lively.
When I went to Majorda and other beaches
in my Goa trip, my problems seemed very small
in front of the never-ending sea. 
It is almost like 
nature makes me forget all of the issues in my mind.
Maybe for just 30 minutes but it does work.
But then travelling all the time too 
is not possible. 
There comes the feeling of seeing your family
and it takes me back to home.

**People** are the true meaning of life is what I believe.
We're social beings and good connections, relationships and
bonding can alone lead us to satisfactory if not happy life.
I like to prioritize people in my life and it's a very
good feeling to have family, friends whom you can talk to
and share things with. But there's no single person in 
life who knows all the aspects of my life.
We're different person with parents, siblings, friends, colleagues etc.
Do you have people in your life who knows all the faces of you?
If you have then I guess you're lucky. 
I certainly am not. The thing with people is all sorts
of complications, expectations and integrity.

It for some reason reminds me of lines of a poetry I read somwehre.

```
Kabhi koi apna hota hai toh farz mohabbat,
Kabhi maang li kisi gair se toh karz mohabbat

Kabhi haal chaal poochne ke peeche sawaal mohabbat,
To kabhi jawaab mein haan sunne ka khwaab mohabbat
```

All of these thoughts are weird when they flow,
and all it makes me think "I don't know where I'm heading,
but I'm on my way".
