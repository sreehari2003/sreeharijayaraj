Maazi is a personal diary app, which I wrote to practically learn React native, enough that I can create standard app and good enough to be pushed in App stores. The app lets your write diary entries or record as voice entries and store in cloud. Your account data is secure and can only be accessed by you.

## Features

- Write your entries in a beautiful space
- Or record it to listen to later
- Search through past entries
- Beautiful dark mode
- Free cloud and syncing
- Available for Android, iOS
