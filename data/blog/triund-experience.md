Long story short, it was an incredible experience.
Right from the starting point at Hotel Nature Feast
to Bhagsu Waterfall checkpoint to the top of Triund and the people,
everything helped me feel more lively and inspiring.

All I want to remember from the trek is
how everyone from the group went crazy around
bonfire, danced on Arijit and said random shit
and commentary on the songs.

The dance part specifically was 
something I'm going to remember for a long time.
Everyone was around the bonfire,
we didn't have network so people were
playing random songs from their offline collection.
And we danced like hell, till 11-ish, 
after which I wasn't evening feeling cold
anymore (:, and it must've been like 0 degrees at that time.
